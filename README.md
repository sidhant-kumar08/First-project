I have Made a Portfolio website for me by using technologies like HTML, CSS, JAVASCRIPT.
JUST TO TEST MY KNOWLEDGE ON WHATEVER I'VE LEARNT I'VE MADE THIS PROJECT , THIS WEBSITE IS NOT RESPONSIVE YET FOR MOBILE DEVICES.
AND THIS CAN ALSO CONTAINS SOME KIND OF MINOR ISSUES BUT I'LL LEARN FROM THOSE MISTAKES.
PRACTICE MAKES A MAN PERFECT.
THAT'S IT.
